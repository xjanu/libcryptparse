LibCryptParse
=============
A **work in progress** C99 library for parsing linux' `/proc/crypto` file.

Now also collecting `/proc/crypto` files from the wild to analyze them and search for
common patterns.

Build instructions
------------------
Out-of-source build:
```
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake ../
make
```
This will build both the `libcryptparse` library and `lscrypto` executable and
place them in the `build/` directory.

To build just the library, run `make cryptparse` instead. For development build,
you may want to run cmake with the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag, for building
a static library run cmake with `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` flag.

Contributing
------------
For now, you can help by running `./collect.sh` on your Linux machine. It should
be run from the project root directory and it will save a copy of your
`/proc/crypto` file into the `samples/` subdirectory. You may run
`cryptsetup benchmark` to load additional common ciphers/modes.

Observations
------------
Below is a table of relationships between cipher type and which fields it may
contain. A ✔ means the field is _always_ present, a ✕ means that field is
_never_ present, a . means the field may or may not be present. It may also
happen that a whole row is just empty, this happens if the supplied crypto file
lacks a cipher of that type.

This table is generated by the `./parse.py` script, which takes paths to crypto
files as command line arguments. So you can run `./parse.py /proc/crypto` to
genarate this table for your system, running `./parse.py samples/*/*` should
yield the table below.
